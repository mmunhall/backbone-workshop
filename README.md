backbone-workshop
=================

workshop/start
--------------
Begin here. This branch contains the JavaScript dependencies, some CSS and an index.html file to get started.

workshop/add-dependencies
-------------------------
Create an application.js file with some bootstrap code to get started.

workshop/create-first-objects
-----------------------------
We'll build the first Backbone objects we plan to use in our application.

workshop/start-html-file
------------------------
Begin building the HTML of our application.

workshop/add-list-table
-----------------------
Create the HTML table for the listing of contacts.

workshop/create-list-route
--------------------------
Create a default route for listing contacts.

workshop/init-collection
------------------------
Intialize a collection of contacts, fetch existing saved contacts, and start Backbone.history.start() to route the default URL.

workshop/temp-reset
-------------------
Since we have no exiting contacts to fetch, we'll replace fetch() with reset() until we have implemented the create feature of the application.

workshop/create-recordview-template
-----------------------------------
Create a template for our record view.

workshop/begin-recordview
-------------------------
Add some properties to the record view object so that contacts will be rendered into the page.

workshop/add-another-contact
----------------------------
Add another object to the collection for good measure. Notice that we are now passing an array to reset rather than a single object. Also, note that any name/value pair can be sent and the model will be dutifully created using that inforamtion.
